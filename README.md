For launching the server you must have installed a node and a npm version
After cloning the repo change the directory to <server> and run the command npm install(this will install all the node modules needed to run the program)
After installing the modules you have to copy the env file(that I sent you) and put it under the directory <server/config>
Run the command npm run dev (you should be in the server directory) the server will be launched
